# 💾 Backups (daemon)

## 📌 Description

The backup execution module on the node: creating, restoring and rotating backups of applications. Policies and schedules can be set by the platform ([💾 features/backups](https://github.com/AdminServiceCloud/asc-platform/blob/main/docs/features/backups.md)), but the module also works fully standalone via the CLI (`asc backup ...`) — no platform account required.

## 🎯 Scenarios

- `asc backup create <app>` — back up an app to its configured storages (`local` by default), or a specific one with `--storage <name>` (repeatable).
- `asc backup restore <app> <backup-id>` — restore; the app must be stopped first (destructive: replaces its repository, config and data).
- `asc backup list <app> [--storage <name>]` — an app's backups on one storage, oldest first.
- `asc backup prune <app> --keep <n> [--storage <name>]` — delete the oldest backups beyond `n` by hand (rotation also runs automatically after `create`, from the app's own `keep` setting).
- `asc backup storage add|list|remove` — manage where backups go; `asc app settings <app>` (category `backups`) — which of those storages this app backs up to, how many copies to keep, and how often (the schedule runs inside the daemon, see [⏰ scheduler](scheduler.md)).

## 🏗️ Technical design

### What's backed up

An archive (`tar.gz`) of the app directory's `repository/`, `config/` and `data/` subdirectories — everything except `meta.json` (regenerated on restore, like a [🧬 clone](app-management.md)). `asc.backup.yaml` at the package repository root excludes paths from the archive:

```yaml
exclude:
  - data/cache/**
  - repository/vendor
```

Patterns are relative to the app directory and support `*` (any run of characters within one path segment), `**` (any run, crossing `/`) and `?` (one character); excluding a directory excludes everything under it, like `.gitignore`. No file is a substitute for application-level consistency (e.g. a database dump) — pre/post backup hooks are a later increment.

### Storages (`BackupStorage` trait, `src/daemon/backup/storage.rs`)

- **`local`** — always available, no setup: a plain directory (`<data_dir>/backups`, i.e. `/var/lib/asc/backups` by default). This is the only storage kind that actually transfers anything today.
- **`s3` / `ftp` / `sftp`** — configurable via `asc backup storage add <name> --type s3|ftp|sftp ...` (connection details persist like registry sources — a system list `/etc/asc/backup-storages.toml`, root-managed and visible to everyone, plus a user list `~/.config/asc/backup-storages.toml`; the file is 0600, since it may hold credentials). The provider fields are validated and stored, but `push`/`pull`/`list`/`remove` are not wired up to a real transfer yet — every operation returns a clear "not implemented" error naming the provider. Use `local` (optionally pointed at a mounted network share via `--type local --dir <path>`) until these ship.
- A configured storage's name cannot be `local` (reserved) and a regular user cannot shadow or remove a system-scoped storage, same rules as [📦 registry sources](package-manager.md).

### Backup policy (`asc app settings` → `backups`)

Stored under the `$backup` reserved key in `config/settings.json`, alongside `$quota`/`$start_command` (same convention, DMN-017/030): `storages` (multi-select, toggled by number in the editor), `keep` (copies to retain per storage — pruned automatically right after each `create`), `schedule` (`daily@HH:MM`, bare `HH:MM`, or a five-field cron expression `min hour day month weekday`; validated by the editor). **`schedule` is enforced by the daemon's scheduler** ([⏰ scheduler](scheduler.md), DMN-012): once a minute it evaluates every app's policy against the node's local time and runs the due backups to the policy's storages with the policy's `keep` rotation — the daemon must be running (`asc service install` or `asc serve`). `asc backup create <app>` without `--storage` uses the policy's storages, falling back to `local` alone when the policy is empty.

### Restore

Downloads the archive to a local temp file, then **replaces** the app directory's `repository/`, `config/` and `data/` wholesale (removed, then extracted) — the result is exactly the backed-up snapshot, not a merge with whatever was there. The CLI refuses to restore over a running app.
